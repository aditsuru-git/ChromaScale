# Contributing to ChromaScale

Thank you for considering contributing! This guide explains the minimal steps to contribute safely.

---

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork the repository** and create a branch from `dev`:

```bash
git checkout dev
git pull origin dev
git checkout -b feature/your-feature
```

Use branch naming conventions like:

- `feature/<short-description>` â€“ for new features
- `fix/<issue-number>-<short-description>` â€“ for bug fixes
- `docs/<topic>` â€“ for documentation

2. **Make your changes** and commit them:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Brief description of changes"
```

3. **Push your branch** to your fork:

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature
```

4. **Open a Pull Request** from your branch to `dev` on the main repository.

5. **Contact the maintainer** if you need clarification or guidance.

## Notes

- Keep contributions focused and concise.
- Update documentation if your change affects functionality.
- Only PRs to the `dev` branch will be accepted; do **not** PR directly to `main`.

Thank you for helping make ChromaScale better! ðŸš€
